    "text": "H.W. Heathcote: epidemiologic models are deterministic models for infectious diseases which are spread by direct person-to-person contact in a population.\nThis kind of models has been used since by a few decades by economist, for matters that have nothing to do with health.\n\ndiffusion of information, or opinions on social medias\nasset prices and fads\nexpectation formation for macroeconomic outcomes (ex: The Epidemiology of Macroeconomic Expectations by Chris Carroll)\n\nEpidemiologic models have two features that depart from standard economic models:\n\nAgent’s behaviour does not take the full system into account. It is irrational in the sense that it isn’t forward looking. Instead, an agent is given a behavioural heuristic.\nThe transitions of the whole system can be determined without solving for complex interactions first.\n\nUnderstanding why these two assumptions are very costly for economists will keep us busy during a big part of the course. Here we just consider two simple models as small programming exercises.\n\nSimple SIR model\nThere is a continuum of agents of mass \\(1\\). Each agent can be either “Susceptible” (S), “Infected” (I) or “Recovered” (R). In each period, one agent meets another agent drawn randomly. During a meeting Susceptible agents who meet an infected agent, will always catch the disease (or the fad) but are not contagious. Infected agents, have a probability \\(\\pi\\) of being recovered. Nothing happens to Recovered agents who meet other people. No distinction is made between recovering as a healthy or a dead person.\nWe’re interested in the evolution in the number infected persons, both the speed of infection and the total amount of infected people in every period.\nWrite down the transition equations for \\(n_I\\), the number of infected people, for \\(n_R\\) the number of recovered people and \\(n_S\\) the number of susceptible people.\n# your text here\nCompute the transition function f for the vector state \\(s_t\\) returning \\(s_{t+1}\\).\n\n# your code here\n\nCompute the transitions over \\(T\\) periods. Plot the result using Plots.jl. (bonus: check against closed form solution)\n\n# your code here\n\nWe now assume a Susceptible person who meets an infected one has a probability \\(\\mu\\) of catching the disease. Update the transition function. Update function \\(f\\) and write a function of \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\pi\\) which returns the simulation. Compare different values of the parameters. How would you interpret “social distancing”? How would you choose parameters \\(\\Pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\)\n\n# your code here\n\n\n\nA Spatial SIR model\nWe now consider another version of the model where agents evolve in the space \\(\\mathcal{S}=[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\). There are \\(N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) agent. At any date, each agent \\(n \\in [0,1]\\) is located at \\((x_n,y_n)\\in \\mathcal{S}\\).\nEach agent moves follows a random walk bounded by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): \\[x_t = \\min(\\max( x_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, 0), 1)\\] \\[y_t = \\min(\\max( y_{t-1} + \\eta_t, 0), 1)\\] where \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are both normally distributed with standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\nAt any date, the individual state of an agent is \\(s_t=(x_t, y_t, h_t)\\) where \\(h_t\\) is either “S”, “I” or “R”. \\(v_t\\) denotes the states of all agents (for instance \\(v_t=(s_{n,t})_n\\). The health status of each agent is updated in the following way:\n\nAgents \\(R\\) stay \\(R\\).\nAgents \\(I\\) have probability \\(\\pi\\) to become \\(R\\). They stay \\(I\\) otherwise.\nAn agent of type \\(S\\) in position \\((x,y)\\) has a probability \\(prob(x,y,S)\\) to be infected that is \\(\\mu\\) if there is another infected agent within a radius \\(r&gt;0\\).\n\nDefine a type Agent, which holds the type of an agent. The state of the whole system will be held in a Vector[Agent] type.\n\n# your code here\n\nWrite a function spatial_transition(S::Vector{Agent})::Vector{Agent} to compute the transition of the positions. Write another function random_guess(T=100) which simulates for \\(T\\) periods in order to find a good initial guess.\n\n# your code here\n\nWrite a function show_population to plot all agents with different colors for different health status.\n\n# your code here\n\nWrite a function evolve(S::Vector[Agent])::Vector[Agent] which takes the population in a given state and returns the same population with updated health status.\n\n# your code here\n\nWrite a function simulate(S0::Vector[Agent], k=1) to simulate the economy starting from an initially random position with k infected individuals. The returned object should be of type Vector[Vector[Agent]].\n\n# your code here\n\nCompute statistics along a simulated path for \\(n_I\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_R\\). Plot and compare with the basic SIR model\n\n# your code here\n\n\n\nAdditional questions\nHave fun by trying to answer one of these questions:\n\nchange probability of infection so that it depends on the number of infected people in the vincinity (with some suitable functional formulation for)\ncompute an animation of the transition\ncompute an interactive visualisation (with Interact.jl if available)"

    "text": "I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, “Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from?” The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word “research”. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let’s kill two birds with one stone. Let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it’s impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n\n— Richard Bellman, Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography (1984, page 159)"
